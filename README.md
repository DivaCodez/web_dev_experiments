## 📖 Repository Overview
This repository acts as my digital notebook for everything related to web development. It documents my academic assignments, independent logic tests, and conceptual experiments.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explored

### 1. HTML Forms & User Input Logic
*   **State Management Basics:** Understanding how browsers handle user data before any backend processing.
*   **Validation Logic:** Using HTML5 attributes (`pattern`, `required`, `accept`) to enforce rules on the client side.
*   **Accessibility First:** Structuring forms with `<label>` and `for` attributes to ensure screen readers can interpret the UI logically.

### 2. CSS Layout Mechanisms
*   **Document Flow Interruption:** Experimenting with `position: absolute` and negative margins to break elements out of the normal flow.
*   **Component Isolation:** Using CSS to create reusable, independent UI components rather than styling whole pages at once.

### 3. DOM Manipulation (Vanilla JS)
*   **Selecting & Modifying:** Using `document.querySelector()` to find elements and dynamically changing their content or styles based on user interaction.
*   **Event Listening:** Attaching events (like `click` or `submit`) and understanding the event loop conceptually.

### 4. API Design & Data Validation (FastAPI)Pydantic Schemas: 
*   **Enforcing strict data types and structural rules:** for incoming JSON payloads using Python classes.
*   **RESTful Routing:** Mapping standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT) to dedicated backend functions for clear data fetching and manipulation.
*   **Automatic Documentation:** Exploring interactive environments like Swagger UI (/docs) to test endpoints live without a frontend.

### 5. Reactive UI & State Management (Streamlit):
*   **Top-Down Script Execution:** Adapting to Streamlit’s unique execution flow, where the entire script reruns from scratch on every user action.
*   **Widget Interactivity:** Binding variables directly to native components (like st.text_input or st.form) to instantly capture user inputs.
*   **Dynamic UI Updates:** Refreshing the browser interface seamlessly using conditional blocks based on live data fetched from the API.
